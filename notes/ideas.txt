Event log: Be able to build graphs of events from participant creation to the distribution of their secret for all members/actions
Possible pub/sub architecture: There are many triggers/events that need to happen; also the scale able to be accomodated
Use ZKP for auth?: HTTP Signature + ZKP at each signed request
Votes data: Define a generic schema for different types of votes/multiple parameters. Build protocol
Detecting malicious voting: Need to brainstorm on this
Who can modify secret members on successful vote?
Map crypto communication: Keys to operation where in the graph of operations
Map client/server sequencing so only building minimal components, not both sides entirely
Homomorphic encryption at rest
How close can we bring this to the blockchain?
